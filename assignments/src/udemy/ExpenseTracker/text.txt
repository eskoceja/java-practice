Project Title: "Expense Tracker"

Description:
Create a command-line expense tracker that allows users to track their expenses.
The expense tracker should allow users to add expenses, view expenses,
calculate total expenses, and generate expense reports.

Requirements:

1. Create a class named Expense that represents an expense with attributes
    like date, category, amount, and description.

2. Create a class named ExpenseTracker that manages the expenses. It should have methods to
    add expenses, view expenses, calculate total expenses, and generate expense reports.

3. Implement a menu-based user interface where users can interact with the expense tracker system
    by entering commands.

4. The menu should include options to add an expense, view expenses, calculate total expenses,
    and generate an expense report.

5. Handle user input and perform the corresponding operations based on the selected menu option.

6. Use appropriate data structures (e.g., ArrayList or HashMap) to store and manage the expenses.

7. Add error handling to handle invalid user input or situations where an expense is not found.

8. Provide a way for users to exit the program.

You can start by creating the Expense and ExpenseTracker classes, implementing the basic functionality,
and then gradually add more features and improvements. For example, you could add the ability to filter
expenses by date or category, generate expense reports in different formats (e.g., CSV or PDF), or
implement data persistence by saving expenses to a file.
